#Elasti Collisions in JavaScript

Many thanks to [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) for his YouTube video and code about elastic collisions in JS.
This is a recreation of the project without using any external libraries (like P5.js in his case). The goal is to better understand elastic collisions basics so they can be integrated in other game projects or game engines.
No LLM generated code was used.

##Running the code

Just clone or download the two files: index.html and script.js and run the index.html page in your browser.
